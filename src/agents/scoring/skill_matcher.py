"""
Skill matching — the one scoring component that owns a dependency.

Everything here needs the controlled vocabulary, and nothing else in Agent 3
does. That is the seam the split follows.

The vocabulary arrives by constructor injection, the same contract Agent 2 now
uses, so a test can hand this class a five-word index instead of standing up an
agent that loads a 679-skill file and an ML model to check that "Java" does not
match "JavaScript".

This class deliberately knows nothing about `CVProfile` or `JobPosting`: it
takes and returns skill names. Its caller does the unpacking.

        Find which of job_skills the CV covers.

        Both sides have already been resolved to canonical names by
        `normalize`, so a direct set membership test is the match. There used to
        be a ~45-key synonym dict rebuilt as a local literal on every call --
        once per job, plus once per missing skill -- which made it tens of
        thousands of reconstructions per upload. It was also unreachable: its
        keys and aliases are lowercase, while 667 of the 669 canonical names
        carry uppercase, so the comparison could never fire for any skill the
        vocabulary recognised. The two cases it did cover (devops, ai) were
        genuine vocabulary gaps and are now canonical entries in skills.json.

        Partial credit is granted on whole tokens, not raw substrings. The

        "Java" against "JavaScript", "Git" against "GitHub Actions", "SQL"
        against "MySQL", and ".NET" reduced to "net" against the "net" inside
        "PeNETration Testing". Twenty-nine such collisions exist among the 669
        canonical names.

        Requiring the job skill's tokens to be a subset of the CV skill's
        tokens removes all of those while keeping the cases where one skill
        genuinely contains the other as a named concept: "Communication"
